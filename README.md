# text-based-checkers
## Goal:
When the user(s) executes the program, the program will create the standard checkers board and place the pieces in their starting positions. To play, the user in turn can select one of their pieces by inputting its coordinates, printing a list of all the coorinates of valid spaces for that piece to move to. Then, they can input the coordinate of they space they want to move to, or cancel their piece selection.<br>
If the user tried to select a piece that is not theirs or a piece that does not have any valid space to move to, nothing happens. Once a player has had all their pieces eliminated, the opposing players wins. <br>
At any point, the user(s) can input a command to reset the pieces. A text-based image of the current board and the location of all the pieces will be printed to the terminal before each user input so that the user(s) may know what the board looks like.

## Milestone 1:
Create the board and a system to keep track of where pieces are.
